# 1. Introduction
- Brief Overview of the Task
In this task, the goal was to delve into the world of energy storages and energy markets, focusing on the influence of various factors on energy trading with energy storage systems. 
The primary objective was to develop a simplified algorithm capable of estimating the cycle costs required to achieve a specific average daily cycle count for an energy storage system, without breaching the maximum daily number of cycles.
# Theoretical Background
- Electricity Grids and Frequency: Electricity grids operate at a certain frequency, maintained when the supply and demand of electricity are matched. Deviations in this balance could lead to grid instability and power failures.
- Energy Storage Systems: With the increasing incorporation of renewable energies, grid-scale energy storage systems, particularly battery energy storage systems, provide additional flexibility and are optimal for short-term electricity markets.
- Battery Usage and Degradation: The usage of battery storage is measured in cycles, and frequent usage accelerates degradation. The batteries are used to exploit price spreads by buying energy during low-price periods and selling it during high-price periods.
- Cycle Costs: These are associated with one cycle of storage usage and are used to determine the minimum spread required for storage operation to be economically viable.
- # Objective
The objective was to develop a Python-based solution to estimate cycle costs, considering factors like efficiency, storage limitations, and price signals, while adhering to the given constraints on average and maximum daily cycles.
# 4. Algorithm Development
- Overview of the Algorithm
The core of the task was to develop an algorithm that dynamically calculates the average cycle costs based on various parameters, constraints, and market data.

- Considerations and Assumptions
The algorithm incorporated considerations for efficiency, storage limitations (nominal power and usable capacity), and constraints on the target and maximum average cycles per 24-hour time horizon.

- Approach for Estimating Cycle Costs
The algorithm employed a dynamic approach, iterating through possible cycle counts and exploring all possible charging and discharging times to find the optimal price spread for each cycle. It calculated the best daily profit and subsequently, the average cycle cost.

# 6. Conclusion
- Summary of Findings
The developed algorithm successfully estimates the average cycle costs, providing valuable insights into energy trading with storage systems in the context of market price dynamics and storage constraints.

- Implications and Final Thoughts
The calculated cycle costs have implications for optimizing the operation of energy storage systems and maximizing profitability in energy markets. The approach lays the groundwork for further refinement and adaptation to more complex market scenarios and storage systems.
